# Student Performance Analysis 🎓

This project is a beginner-friendly Data Science analysis that studies how different factors affect students' academic performance.

## 📊 Objective
To analyze how factors such as **gender**, **test preparation**, and **study time** impact students’ exam scores.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Students who completed test preparation courses performed better.  
- Female students scored slightly higher in reading and writing.  
- Visualization helped identify key patterns between different attributes.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Loaded and cleaned student performance dataset.  
2. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).  
3. Created visualizations to compare test scores by gender and preparation.  
4. Derived insights to understand performance trends.

## 📁 Dataset
Sample dataset: *Student Performance Dataset (from Kaggle)*
